# Crop Recommendation Model ðŸŒ±

## Overview
This project implements a **machine learning-based crop recommendation system** that analyzes soil and environmental factors to suggest the most suitable crops for farming. The model is trained using real-world agricultural data to enhance decision-making in farming practices.

## Features
âœ… Data preprocessing and feature engineering for improved model accuracy  
âœ… Multiple machine learning models trained and evaluated for optimal performance  
âœ… Visualizations to understand data distribution and model insights  
âœ… Easy-to-use Jupyter Notebooks for experimentation and reproducibility  

## Machine Learning Models Used
The following machine learning models were trained and evaluated:
- **Logistic Regression**
- **Random Forest Classifier**
- **Decision Tree Classifier**
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
- **NaÃ¯ve Bayes**
- **Gradient Boosting Algorithms (XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost)**

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project includes soil characteristics (e.g., **pH, nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium levels**) and environmental factors (e.g., **temperature, rainfall, humidity**). Proper data cleaning and transformations were performed to prepare the data for model training. This is a publicly available dataset on Kaggle.

## Analyses Performed
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Understanding data distribution, correlations, and key insights.
- **Feature Engineering**: Selecting important variables, handling missing data, and transforming features.
- **Model Training & Evaluation**: Training multiple models, tuning hyperparameters, and measuring performance.
- **Performance Metrics Analysis**: Using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix to evaluate models.
- **Data Visualization**: Graphical representation of insights, feature importance, and decision boundaries.
